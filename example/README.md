comments/example
================

Example code for using the comments package. The files folder contains files with various comment styles.

Usage: example [file]

(omitting filename will cause the program to fall back to stdin)

###Use

To use, remove the "_test.go" extension before building (the suffix prevents the "go get" command from installing this example directory).
